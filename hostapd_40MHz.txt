# get hostapd source code

# patch the 40MHz check
cd wpa-2.1
find and comment below code in src/ap/hw_features.c
```
        if (!oper40) {
                wpa_printf(MSG_INFO, "20/40 MHz operation not permitted on "
                           "channel pri=%d sec=%d based on overlapping BSSes",
                           iface->conf->channel,
                           iface->conf->channel +
                           iface->conf->secondary_channel * 4);
                iface->conf->secondary_channel = 0;
        }
```
also can be more verbose if adding below
```
        wpa_printf(MSG_INFO, "Force 20/40 MHz operation on "
                   "channel pri=%d sec=%d based on overlapping BSSes",
                   iface->conf->channel,
                   iface->conf->channel +
                   iface->conf->secondary_channel * 4);
```

# build the package
fakeroot debian/rules binary

# install the package
There will be three .deb files in the same place as wpa-2.1.
hostapd_2.1-0ubuntu7.3_i386.deb
wpagui_2.1-0ubuntu7.3_i386.deb
wpasupplicant_2.1-0ubuntu7.3_i386.deb

we only need to install the hostapd for this case.
sudo dpkg -i hostapd_2.1-0ubuntu7.3_i386.deb
